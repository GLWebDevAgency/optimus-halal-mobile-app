## 1. Foundational Principles

### The Prohibition of Khamr

The prohibition of khamr (intoxicants) is established by the Quran, the Sunnah, and scholarly consensus (ijma'):

**Quranic basis:**
> "O you who believe! Intoxicants (khamr), gambling, [sacrificing on] stone altars, and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Shaytan, so avoid it that you may be successful." (Al-Ma'idah 5:90)

The verb used is *ijtanibu* ("avoid entirely"), which classical scholars consider the strongest form of prohibition in the Quran -- stronger than *la taf'alu* ("do not do").

**The key scholarly question** is not whether khamr is haram -- that is unanimous -- but rather:
1. What constitutes khamr? (definition scope)
2. Does trace alcohol in food = khamr? (threshold question)
3. Does transformation remove the ruling? (istihala question)

---

## 2. Key Hadith Corpus

### Hadith 1: Universal definition of khamr
> "Every intoxicant is khamr, and every khamr is haram."
> -- Sahih Muslim, 2003

**Significance:** This hadith extends the prohibition beyond grape wine to ALL intoxicating substances. It is the basis for the jumhur (majority) position against the early Hanafi distinction.

### Hadith 2: The small-quantity principle
> "Whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a small quantity of it is haram."
> -- Abu Dawud, 3681; al-Tirmidhi, 1865; Ibn Majah, 3393; graded sahih

**Critical interpretation dispute:** This hadith is the most debated in this entire domain. Two readings exist:

- **Reading A (Strict):** If a SUBSTANCE can intoxicate when consumed in large amounts, then even a drop of THAT SUBSTANCE is haram. Under this reading, pure ethanol is always haram regardless of quantity.

- **Reading B (Contextual, adopted by Ibn Uthaymeen and others):** If a particular DRINK/FOOD would intoxicate when consumed in large quantities, then a small amount of THAT SAME DRINK/FOOD is haram. Under this reading, a cake containing 0.1% ethanol from vanilla is NOT the same "drink" as wine; since consuming large quantities of cake would never intoxicate, the cake is halal.

**Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen** explicitly endorsed Reading B:
> "Not every alcoholic content in a thing makes it haram. Rather, if something contains a percentage of alcohol which will make a person intoxicated if he drinks it, then it is haram. But if the amount is minuscule and does not have any effect, then it is halal."
> -- Cited in IslamQA fatwa #59899 and IslamWeb fatwa #301753

**Sheikh Ibn Baz** confirmed the same principle:
> "Whatever intoxicates in large quantities is forbidden in small quantities" -- applied to the FINAL PRODUCT, not the ingredient in isolation.
> -- binbaz.org.sa, fatwa #7421

### Hadith 3: Source specification
> "Khamr is from these two trees: the date palm and the grape vine."
> -- Sahih Muslim, 1985

**Significance:** This is the basis for the early Hanafi distinction (Abu Hanifa and Abu Yusuf's position) that only grape/date-derived intoxicants carry the full khamr ruling. This position has been superseded in the Hanafi school itself (see Section 4).

---

## 3. Two Critical Legal Concepts: Istihala & Istihlak

These two concepts are the backbone of contemporary rulings on alcohol in food. They are distinct but often applied together.

### 3.1 Istihala (Chemical Transformation)

**Definition:** The complete chemical transformation of a substance's properties, resulting in the formation of a new substance with different characteristics, such that the original ruling no longer applies.

**The paradigmatic example:** Wine transforming into vinegar. All four madhabs agree that vinegar derived from wine is halal, though they differ on whether deliberate conversion is permissible:

| Madhab | Natural conversion | Deliberate conversion |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Hanafi | Halal (consensus) | Halal |
| Maliki | Halal (consensus) | Haram (majority position) |
| Shafi'i | Halal (consensus) | Haram (relied-upon position) |
| Hanbali | Halal (consensus) | Disputed (two narrations from Ahmad) |

**Application to alcohol in food:** When alcohol undergoes chemical change during food processing (e.g., reacting with other compounds, evaporating, being metabolized during fermentation), some scholars apply istihala to declare the resulting product halal.

**Egyptian Dar al-Ifta** (dar-alifta.org, fatwa #6879):
> "Scholars have unanimously agreed that alcohol is deemed pure if it spontaneously transforms into vinegar. Additionally, the majority of Hanafi and Maliki scholars, as well as in an opinion stated by Imam Ahmad, maintained that any impure substance -- apart from alcohol which has spontaneously turned into vinegar -- is deemed pure if it has undergone istihala, because the impure nature of such a substance is transformed and completely changed."

### 3.2 Istihlak (Negligible Absorption/Dissolution)

**Definition:** The state where a prohibited substance is present in such negligible quantity within a permissible substance that it has no detectable trace (in terms of taste, color, or smell) and cannot produce any effect (intoxication), even if the mixture were consumed in large quantities.

**Classical basis:** Scholars are unanimously agreed that if some impurity (najasa) falls into water but does not change the water's color, taste, or smell, then the water remains pure (tahir). This principle is extended by analogy to food containing trace alcohol.

**Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen:**
> "If a small quantity of alcohol is so submerged in something else that it has no tangible or theoretical effect, then the substance keeps the ruling that is in accordance with its own attributes."

**Egyptian Dar al-Ifta** (dar-alifta.org, fatwa #9396):
> "Istihlak means that the percentage of alcohol in a certain substance is so negligible that it does not lead to intoxication, even if a person drinks large amounts of it."

### The Crucial Difference

- **Istihala** = the alcohol has been chemically TRANSFORMED into a different substance (e.g., acetic acid in vinegar). The haram substance no longer exists.
- **Istihlak** = the alcohol still technically exists but in quantities so negligible they have zero effect. The haram substance is ABSORBED/DISSOLVED beyond any impact.

Both concepts can render a product permissible, but they operate differently. Istihala is stronger (unanimously accepted for vinegar); istihlak is more debated but broadly accepted by contemporary scholars.

## 4. Madhab Positions on Alcohol (Khamr) Definition

### 4.1 The Hanafi School -- The Unique Position

The Hanafi school contains an internal debate that is critical to understanding contemporary alcohol rulings:

**Position of Abu Hanifa and Abu Yusuf (the early position):**
- *Khamr* in the strict sense refers ONLY to intoxicants derived from raw grape juice or raw date juice.
- Intoxicants from other sources (honey, barley, wheat, figs, etc.) are called *nabidh* or *muskir*, not *khamr*.
- Nabidh from non-grape/date sources is haram only in intoxicating quantities. A small, non-intoxicating amount was considered permissible.
- This is based on Hadith 3 above ("Khamr is from these two trees").

**Position of Imam Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani:**
- All intoxicants, regardless of source, carry the SAME ruling as khamr.
- Small and large quantities of any intoxicant are equally haram.
- This aligns with the jumhur (majority of scholars).

**The relied-upon position (al-mufta bihi / al-mu'tamad) in the Hanafi school today:**
- The position of Imam Muhammad is the one upon which fatwa is given in the Hanafi school.
- Ibn Abidin (the great late Hanafi authority) explains: "The fatwa is given on the view of Imam Muhammad due to the hadith 'Every intoxicant is khamr and every intoxicant is unlawful' recorded by Imam Muslim."
- Contemporary Hanafi muftis (Darul Uloom Deoband, Darul Ifta Birmingham, etc.) unanimously follow Imam Muhammad's position.

**However**, the early Abu Hanifa/Abu Yusuf distinction has practical relevance for one specific application: it underpins the Hanafi position that industrial ethanol (derived from petroleum or grain, not grapes/dates) is not *khamr* in the strictest sense, and therefore its trace presence in food through processing may be evaluated more leniently. This is NOT a license to drink it, but it affects purity (tahara) rulings and food classification.

### 4.2 The Shafi'i School

- All intoxicants are khamr, regardless of source.
- Any amount of any intoxicant is haram.
- The Shafi'i school applies the hadith "Whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a small quantity of it is haram" strictly.
- However, the Shafi'i school is generally MORE accepting of istihala than the Hanbali school, which provides relief in food cases where alcohol has been fully transformed.

### 4.3 The Maliki School

- All intoxicants are khamr, regardless of source.
- Both small and large quantities are haram.
- The Maliki school is notably broad in accepting istihala -- impure substances that undergo complete transformation become pure. This is relevant for processed foods where alcohol is used as a carrier and then fully evaporates or transforms.

### 4.4 The Hanbali School

- All intoxicants are khamr, regardless of source.
- Both small and large quantities are haram.
- The Hanbali school is the STRICTEST on istihala -- Ahmad ibn Hanbal is reported to have rejected deliberate transformation as purification (e.g., deliberately making wine into vinegar). However, natural/spontaneous transformation is accepted.
- Ibn Taymiyah (Hanbali) stated: "If alcohol falls into water and is completely absorbed in it... he is not regarded as drinking alcohol" (Al-Mustadrak 'ala Majmu' al-Fatawa). This shows even the Hanbali tradition accepts istihlak.

## 5. Case 1: Ethanol as Carrier in Flavorings (Vanilla Extract, Fruit Flavors)

### The Facts
- Vanilla extract typically contains 35% ethanol by volume as a solvent/carrier.
- When used in baking or food production, the amount added is tiny (a few ml per batch).
- In the final product (cake, ice cream, etc.), residual alcohol is typically 0.1-2%.
- The final product cannot intoxicate regardless of quantity consumed.

### Rulings by Source

**IslamQA.info (Sheikh al-Munajjid), Fatwa #249339:**
> "We did not say that it is permissible to USE alcohol in [vanilla]; rather we said that it is permissible to CONSUME [products containing vanilla] if no trace of alcohol is discernible in it."

This is a critical distinction: **using** alcohol as an ingredient is different from **consuming** a product where alcohol has been absorbed. The former is prohibited as a deliberate act; the latter may be permissible if conditions are met.

**IslamQA.info, Fatwa #201520 -- The Two Scenarios:**
1. If alcohol is fully absorbed into food/drink, has disappeared, and no trace is detectable in color, taste, or odor --> **permissible**
2. If alcohol's essence remains present or traces are detectable --> **haram, even if the percentage is small**

**IslamWeb.net (Fatwa #301753, citing Ibn Uthaymeen):**
> "If the percentage is very small without effect, then it is lawful. For example, a percentage such as 1%, 2% or 3% [does not make it unlawful]."

The fatwa also cites the **8th Seminar of the Islamic Organization for Medical Science** which concluded:
> "Foods where a slight amount of alcohol is used for dissolving insoluble materials... is permissible" based on the principle of "widespread necessity" (al-haja al-'amma).

**Egyptian Dar al-Ifta (Fatwa #6879 and #6245):**
Products containing trace amounts of alcohol used as solvents are **permissible**, applying both istihala and istihlak. The former Grand Mufti of Egypt verified that "chemical alcohol is not considered wine in the first place" and is pure unless sourced from wine.

**AMJA (Assembly of Muslim Jurists of America):**
> "It is permissible to use food products which contain vanilla extract" because ice cream/cake with vanilla extract does not intoxicate in any quantity.

**Sheikh Ibn Baz (binbaz.org.sa, Fatwa #7421):**
If a substance's large quantity does NOT cause intoxication, neither the large nor small quantities are forbidden. The determining factor is the intoxicating capacity of the FINAL product.

### Consolidated Ruling on Case 1

| Position | Ruling | Condition |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Majority of contemporary scholars** | **Permissible** | Final product non-intoxicating; no detectable alcohol trace |
| Stricter minority | Makruh (disliked) to haram | Any presence of ethanol, regardless of quantity |
| IslamQA.info nuance | Permissible to CONSUME | But not permissible to deliberately ADD alcohol as a Muslim cook |
| IIFA Resolution 225 | Permissible as solvent | "Unless there are halal alternatives, and with an amount that does not cause drunkenness" |

### For Naqiy Classification
- Vanilla extract as listed ingredient: **DOUBTFUL** (mashbouh) -- flag for user
- Product confirmed non-intoxicating with absorbed alcohol: **HALAL** according to majority
- User preference toggle recommended (strict vs. standard)

---

## 6. Case 2: Naturally Occurring Alcohol (Bread, Ripe Fruit, Soy Sauce, Vinegar)

### The Facts
- Bread contains 0.04-1.9% ethanol from yeast fermentation.
- Ripe bananas contain up to 0.5% ethanol.
- Natural fruit juices contain 0.1-0.5% ethanol from natural fermentation.
- Soy sauce contains 1.5-2% ethanol from its brewing/fermentation process.
- Vinegar is the direct product of acetic acid fermentation of ethanol.

### Key Distinction: Natural vs. Deliberate Fermentation

**IIFA Resolution 225, Question 12:**
> "There is no objection regarding the presence of traces of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) as a result of natural fermentation, and the maximum limit approved in foods is that level which does not cause drunkenness."

This is a landmark ruling: the International Islamic Fiqh Academy -- representing scholarly consensus from OIC member states -- explicitly permits naturally occurring trace alcohol in food.

**Malaysian National Fatwa Council:**
> "Food or drinks containing naturally occurring ethanol, such as grains, nuts, fruits, and juices, are considered pure and are halal for Muslims."

### The Vinegar Question

Vinegar is the most clear-cut case:
- **All four madhabs** agree that vinegar is halal, even when derived from wine.
- The transformation from wine to vinegar is the textbook example of istihala.
- The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "What a good condiment vinegar is." (Muslim, 2052)
- Even "wine vinegar" or "spirit vinegar" is halal because the substance is no longer wine -- it has become acetic acid.

### Soy Sauce

- Naturally brewed soy sauce (e.g., Kikkoman) undergoes fermentation producing ~1.5-2% ethanol.
- This is NOT added alcohol; it is a byproduct of the natural brewing process.
- The alcohol is then partially evaporated during pasteurization.
- Under istihlak and the IIFA resolution, this falls within the permissible range as the final product cannot intoxicate.

**However:** Soy sauce brands that add alcohol separately (as a preservative) are evaluated differently -- the deliberate addition makes them questionable under the stricter view.

### Bread and Fruit

- No scholar has ever declared bread haram due to fermentation-derived ethanol.
- This represents the strongest practical consensus that trace naturally-occurring alcohol does not affect permissibility.
- The same applies to ripe fruits, natural fruit juices, and fermented foods like yogurt/kefir.

### Consolidated Ruling on Case 2

| Product | Ruling | Basis |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Bread | **Halal** (unanimous) | Natural fermentation, cannot intoxicate |
| Ripe fruit | **Halal** (unanimous) | Natural occurrence, cannot intoxicate |
| Vinegar (all types) | **Halal** (unanimous) | Istihala -- complete transformation |
| Naturally brewed soy sauce | **Halal** (majority) | Natural fermentation, istihlak applies |
| Soy sauce with added alcohol | **Doubtful** (mashbouh) | Deliberate addition -- stricter scholars prohibit |

### For Naqiy Classification
- Vinegar: Always **HALAL** regardless of origin (wine vinegar, spirit vinegar, etc.)
- Bread, fruit, yogurt: **HALAL**
- Naturally brewed soy sauce: **HALAL** (standard) / **DOUBTFUL** (strict mode)
- Soy sauce with added ethanol preservative: **DOUBTFUL**

---

## 7. Case 3: Alcohol in Cooking (Wine Reduction, Rum Cake, etc.)

### The Facts
- Cooking does NOT fully evaporate alcohol. Studies show:
  - Flambeing retains ~75% of the alcohol
  - 15 minutes of simmering retains ~40%
  - 2.5 hours of simmering retains ~5%
  - Alcohol is never 100% eliminated through cooking
- Wine reductions, rum cakes, beer batter, cognac sauces all retain measurable alcohol.

### This is the STRICTEST case -- near-unanimous prohibition

**IIFA Resolution 225, Question 13:**
> "It is not permissible to use alcohol in cooking, even with a single drop."

This is an unambiguous, categorical prohibition from the highest collective fiqh body in the Islamic world.

**IslamQA.info (Fatwa #201520):**
> "Cooking with alcohol is prohibited because heat does not fully evaporate the alcohol -- essence remains present."

**IslamQA.info (Fatwa #249339):**
The fatwa specifically addresses people in Britain who assumed cooking evaporates alcohol and therefore makes food halal. The ruling is clear: deliberate addition of wine/beer/spirits to food during cooking is **haram**, and consuming the resulting food is **haram**.

### Does Evaporation = Istihala?

**No**, according to the overwhelming scholarly majority:

1. **Evaporation is not transformation.** Istihala requires the substance to change into a DIFFERENT substance (like wine becoming vinegar). Evaporation merely reduces the quantity -- the remaining alcohol is still ethanol.

2. **Evaporation is incomplete.** As noted above, significant alcohol remains even after extended cooking.

3. **The act itself is prohibited.** Even if one could somehow argue the final product is permissible, the ACT of adding khamr to food is a sin in itself, as it constitutes using an intoxicant rather than destroying it.

### The Hanafi Nuance

Some have attempted to use the early Hanafi position (Abu Hanifa/Abu Yusuf) to argue that cooking wine is permissible if the result is non-intoxicating. This argument fails on multiple grounds:

1. The mu'tamad position in the Hanafi school follows Imam Muhammad, who prohibits all intoxicants.
2. Even under Abu Hanifa's position, grape wine (the most common cooking wine) IS khamr and is prohibited in any quantity.
3. No major Hanafi fatwa council has ever permitted cooking with wine.

### Consolidated Ruling on Case 3

| Scenario | Ruling | Scholarly basis |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Adding wine to sauce | **HARAM** (near-unanimous) | IIFA Resolution 225; deliberate use of khamr |
| Adding beer to batter | **HARAM** (near-unanimous) | Same principle |
| Rum cake with rum | **HARAM** (near-unanimous) | Same principle |
| Consuming food cooked with wine by others | **HARAM** (majority) | Traces remain; deliberate addition |
| Foods where alcohol fully evaporated (theoretical) | **Still haram** (majority) | The act of adding is prohibited; plus evaporation is never complete |

### For Naqiy Classification
- Products listing "wine," "beer," "rum," "cognac," "liqueur" as cooking ingredients: **HARAM**
- This is one of the clearest cases and should trigger an immediate haram flag
- No user preference toggle -- this is near-unanimous

---

## 8. Case 4: Alcohol in Medicine & Supplements

### The Facts
- Many cough syrups contain 5-25% ethanol as a solvent.
- Some liquid supplements use ethanol as a carrier.
- Mouthwash typically contains 10-25% ethanol.
- Hand sanitizer contains 60-70% isopropyl or ethyl alcohol.
- Some medications have no alcohol-free alternative.

### The General Rule: Prohibited, with Exceptions

**IslamWeb.net (Fatwa #263212):**
> "In principle, all things are pure and lawful, so one should not neglect this ruling except if it is certainly known or predominantly known that there is something (unlawful) in the medicine which makes it necessary to leave it and seek another alternative."

**Sheikh Ibn Baz (binbaz.org.sa, Fatwa #9013):**
- If confirmed intoxicating: avoid
- If uncertain about alcohol content: default is permissibility
- If physicians affirm safety and benefit: consumption is permissible

### The Daroura (Necessity) Principle

The Islamic legal maxim: **"Necessities permit prohibitions"** (al-darurat tubih al-mahdhurat) -- derived from Quran 2:173, 6:119.

**Conditions for daroura to apply to alcohol-containing medicine:**

1. **Genuine medical need** -- the illness must be harmful or dangerous, not merely uncomfortable
2. **No halal alternative available** -- the patient and physician must have genuinely searched for alcohol-free options
3. **Prescribed by a trustworthy physician** -- self-medication does not qualify as easily
4. **Minimum necessary quantity** -- the necessity is evaluated proportionally (al-darura tuqaddar bi-qadriha)

**IslamWeb.net (Fatwa #263212):**
> "If you did not find an alcohol-free medicine that suits your illness while you were suffering such a harmful condition, then it would be permissible for you to use the drug which contains alcohol."

**Islamic Fiqh Council (cited by IslamWeb):**
> "It is permissible to use medicines containing alcohol in negligible proportions required by the manufacturing process, for which there is no alternative, provided they are prescribed by a trustworthy physician."

### Sub-cases

**Cough Syrup:**
- If alcohol-free alternative exists: must use the alternative
- If no alternative and genuine illness: permissible under daroura
- General-purpose cough syrup with alcohol when alternatives exist: not permissible

**Mouthwash:**
- **IslamQA.info (Fatwa #20034):** "If the alcohol which mouthwash contains is not intoxicating, then it is OK to use it, so long as it is not harmful."
- However, since alcohol-free mouthwash is widely available, most scholars recommend using the alternative.
- Key nuance: mouthwash is NOT swallowed (external use / rinsed out), which affects the ruling.

**Hand Sanitizer:**
- **Permissible** according to the majority of contemporary scholars.
- External application (not consumption) -- the prohibition of khamr relates primarily to drinking.
- The Islamic Fiqh Council has declared that Muslims can use pharmaceuticals containing alcohol for external sterilization.
- Washing hands afterward is recommended but not obligatory.

**Note on Tahara (Purity):** Whether alcohol is najis (ritually impure) is itself debated:
- Hanafi, Maliki, and Shafi'i schools: khamr is najis (impure)
- Some Hanbali scholars and modern researchers: khamr is haram to consume but not necessarily physically najis
- This affects whether alcohol on skin invalidates prayer -- the majority say external alcohol (hand sanitizer) does not invalidate prayer if hands are washed

### Consolidated Ruling on Case 4

| Product | Ruling | Condition |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Medicine with alcohol, no alternative | **Permissible** (daroura) | Genuine need, physician prescribed, minimum quantity |
| Medicine with alcohol, alternative exists | **Haram** to use the alcohol version | Must use the halal alternative |
| Mouthwash with alcohol | **Permissible** (majority) | Not swallowed; preferably use alcohol-free |
| Hand sanitizer | **Permissible** (near-unanimous) | External use, not consumption |
| Supplements with alcohol carrier | **Avoid** if alternative exists | Apply same daroura framework as medicine |

### For Naqiy Classification
- Medicine/supplements are outside Naqiy's food-scanning scope
- If supplements are included: flag alcohol-containing ones as **DOUBTFUL** with note "halal alternatives may exist"
- Hand sanitizer / mouthwash: outside food scope, but if included, mark as **HALAL** (external use)

---

## 9. Case 5: "Alcohol-Free" Beer/Wine (0.0-0.5% ABV)

### The Facts
- "0.0% ABV" products may still contain up to 0.05% alcohol (measurement limitation)
- "Non-alcoholic" or "alcohol-free" labels in many jurisdictions allow up to 0.5% ABV
- Even beverages from Muslim-majority countries (e.g., Barbican from Saudi Arabia) contain trace alcohol (~0.02-0.05%) due to natural fermentation of malt
- The alcohol in these products is a byproduct of brewing, not an added ingredient

### The Intoxication Test

**IslamWeb.net (Fatwa #299059, on beer with 0.5% alcohol):**
The fatwa concludes such beverages are **permissible (halal)** if they do not intoxicate in large quantities.

**Ibn Uthaymeen (cited in the same fatwa):**
> "If the percentage is very small without effect, then it is lawful."

**The Permanent Committee (Saudi Arabia):**
Beverages containing alcohol are permissible when "consumption of a large amount of such a beverage does not intoxicate."

**Sheikh Ibn Baz (binbaz.org.sa, Fatwa #7421):**
If a substance's large quantity does NOT cause intoxication, neither the large nor small quantities are forbidden.

### The Mathematical Reality

To reach intoxication from a 0.5% ABV beverage, a person would need to consume approximately 10-15 liters in rapid succession -- a physiological impossibility, as water intoxication would occur first. Therefore, under the intoxication test, these beverages are categorically non-intoxicating.

### The Tashabbuh (Imitation) Concern

This is the PRIMARY objection raised against non-alcoholic beer, even by scholars who acknowledge it is technically halal:

**IslamWeb.net (Fatwa #87498):**
> "If the alcohol-free beer does not intoxicate then it is lawful to drink it. Calling it beer does not influence the rule as such a drink is originally lawful. Indeed, the rule depends on the reality of the thing, not on its label."

However, the same fatwa notes:
> Purchasing non-alcoholic versions from beer-producing companies still financially supports alcohol producers.

**IslamQA.info (Fatwa #12557):**
The basic principle is that things are halal except what is specifically prohibited. If it does not intoxicate, it is not khamr.

### The Three Scholarly Positions

1. **Permissible (halal):** The drink does not intoxicate, therefore it is not khamr. Naming it "beer" does not change its reality. This is the position of Ibn Uthaymeen, the Permanent Committee, and IslamWeb.

2. **Permissible but better avoided (halal with karaha):** The drink itself is halal, but avoiding it is better due to:
   - Tashabbuh (resemblance to alcohol drinkers)
   - Risk of confusion with actual alcoholic beer
   - Supporting companies that produce actual alcohol
   - Potential to normalize alcohol culture

3. **Prohibited (haram):** A minority position that considers any product designed to imitate khamr as falling under the prohibition, even if technically non-intoxicating. This is based on the principle of *sadd al-dhara'i* (blocking the means to evil).

### Consolidated Ruling on Case 5

| Product | Ruling | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 0.0% ABV malt beverage (e.g., Barbican) | **Halal** (strong majority) | Cannot intoxicate; sold in Muslim countries |
| 0.5% ABV "non-alcoholic" beer | **Halal** (majority) / Makruh (some) | Cannot intoxicate; tashabbuh concern |
| "De-alcoholized" wine | **More contested** | Stronger tashabbuh objection; wine carries heavier stigma |
| Kombucha (0.5% from fermentation) | **Halal** (majority) | Natural fermentation; not imitating alcohol |

### For Naqiy Classification
- 0.0% malt beverages: **HALAL**
- 0.5% "non-alcoholic beer": **DOUBTFUL** (user-preference sensitive)
- De-alcoholized wine: **DOUBTFUL**
- Present tashabbuh concern as informational note, not as haram ruling

## 10. Synthesis: Classification Matrix for Naqiy

Based on the exhaustive analysis above, the following classification matrix should guide Naqiy's algorithm:

### Tier 1: HARAM (Clear Prohibition)

| Ingredient/Product | Basis | Confidence |
|--------------------|-------|------------|
| Wine as cooking ingredient | IIFA Resolution 225 Q13; unanimous | Very High |
| Beer as cooking ingredient | Same principle | Very High |
| Rum/cognac/liqueur in food | Same principle | Very High |
| Any product designed to intoxicate | Quran 5:90; consensus | Very High |

### Tier 2: HALAL (Clear Permission)

| Ingredient/Product | Basis | Confidence |
|--------------------|-------|------------|
| Vinegar (all types including wine vinegar) | Istihala; unanimous across 4 madhabs | Very High |
| Bread (naturally fermented) | Natural fermentation; unanimous | Very High |
| Ripe fruit | Natural occurrence; unanimous | Very High |
| Hand sanitizer (external) | External use; not consumption | High |
| 0.0% malt beverages (Barbican, etc.) | Non-intoxicating; majority scholars | High |

### Tier 3: DOUBTFUL / USER-PREFERENCE (Mashbouh)

| Ingredient/Product | Standard Mode | Strict Mode | Basis |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Vanilla extract in final product | Halal | Doubtful | Majority permits; minority objects |
| Fruit flavoring with ethanol carrier | Halal | Doubtful | Same reasoning |
| Naturally brewed soy sauce | Halal | Doubtful | Natural fermentation but higher % |
| 0.5% "non-alcoholic" beer | Doubtful | Haram | Tashabbuh concern |
| De-alcoholized wine | Doubtful | Haram | Stronger tashabbuh concern |
| Supplements with ethanol carrier | Doubtful | Haram | Alternatives usually exist |

### Decision Flowchart for the Algorithm

```
1. Is alcohol/wine/beer/spirits listed as a COOKING ingredient?
   YES --> HARAM (stop)
   NO --> continue

2. Is the product designed to be an alcoholic beverage (>0.5% ABV)?
   YES --> HARAM (stop)
   NO --> continue

3. Is the product vinegar (any type)?
   YES --> HALAL (stop)
   NO --> continue

4. Is alcohol present due to NATURAL fermentation only?
   YES --> HALAL in standard mode; note for strict mode
   NO --> continue

5. Is alcohol present as a carrier/solvent in flavoring?
   YES --> Check if final product is non-intoxicating
          YES --> HALAL (standard) / DOUBTFUL (strict)
